The Scholars’ Home, a co-educational English medium public school,  was founded in the year 2004 by ‘Thakar Singh Memorial Educational Trust’. The school is open to all irrespective of caste, creed, colour or religion and strictly secular. Above all it is the first TECHNO-SAVVY school in this region.
Our Goal

The founders of the school have envisaged a school where stress free environment would help in the development of intellectual, moral and spiritual faculties of the children.<BR>
 The stated goal of the school is-<BR>

‘To produce well balanced, good human beings of world order who will be able to stand on their own at any forum.’<BR>
Our Ethos<BR>

Creating A Caring Environment<BR>

It is our earnest effort to create a caring environment with stress on moral and spiritual values so the students feel at home away from their homes.<BR>

Generating Environment Sensitivity<BR>

We take pains to generate environment sensitivity among our students. We believe that we are the custodians of our environment and it is our duty to protect it by adopting environment friendly practices. We try to create awareness about the ill effects of our own selfish acts.
<BR>
Creating Excellence in All Walks<BR>

The school lays great stress on doing the things to the best possible with given resources. The students are inspired to put in the extra bit of hard work even in their routine works so that it becomes distinct and excellent.<BR>
Our Mottos<BR>

Shaping the future<BR>

We believe that today’s students are the future citizens of the society. It is only by shaping them properly at the initial stage of character building; our society can be shaped for a better future.
<BR>
Competing with self<BR>

We believe that the only competition that the students need to be exposed to is the competition with self. The students are motivated to compete with self in order to promote congeniality and building a healthy environment to learn.
