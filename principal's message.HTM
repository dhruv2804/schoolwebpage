<B>The aim of education is to draw out of the best out of the body, mind and spirit; not only to widen the mental horizons of the children but also to build their character. It should not only aim at scholastic achievements but also at making them civilized, cultured , disciplined, self reliant , confident and productive citizens of a new emerging India, who are well equipped to meet the current and future challenges. In today’s IT driven world, it is also very important to impart technological education so that future citizens of India emerge as the global citizens.

The Scholars’ Home gives ample opportunities to the students for free thinking, discreet action and self expression. It provides them an environment which ensures overall personality development that equips them with necessary strength and skill to cope up with the ever confident and courageous without losing their cultural roots and values. It strives to provide intellectual, moral and spiritual growth of its students.

We, at The Scholars’ Home, believe in the following philosophy:Emphasis on value based education.

    Emphasis on all round development.
    Better communication between parents and teachers.
    Better communication between students and teachers.
    To prepare students to deal with future challenges.
    Focus on knowledge creation, lifelong learning and development of leadership.
    To be ready to learn, unlearn and relearn.
    To be able to direct change and solve problems.

Let us join our hands, heads and hearts together to fulfill the current needs of the society which are, to name a few –preservation and inculcation of values, humanism, nationalism, global brotherhood, tolerance, love for peace, food and shelter for all.
