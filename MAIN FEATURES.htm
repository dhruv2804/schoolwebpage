The school recognizes the importance of well-rounded education; therefore, an emphasis is laid on holistic education. Students participate in various Inter- and Intra- school competitions such as Essay Writing, Poster Making, Declamation, Debates, Drama, Skits and Quizzes and so on. These competitions present wonderful opportunities to students to apply their skills and learn more. While many competitions are held at school, there are many that are held in other schools and places. There are also contests that student can enter individually or as part of a team. Many of these offer prizes and awards, as well as the chance to travel for national or international competitions.</FONT><br><br><br>

Extra – curricular activities form an integral part of the school curriculum. Our various clubs are the hub of activities and are pride of the school. Under the guidance of teachers, our clubs serve as a platform for students to prove themselves in various fields other than academics. Club activities supplement academics and give the students practical training which they require in day to day life. They also provide excellent networking opportunities for students and a place to meet other students with similar interests and ideas. Thus Clubs provide the students with a platform to showcase what they learn in class and essence of the activities is to make the members better in their fields during the process of performing club activities. The various clubs running at the school are:
